# Contributing

</div>

If you feel like contributing to the project, please do!

If you want to implement something big, please start a discussion about that in the issues! Maybe I've already had
something similar in mind and we can make it happen together. However, keep in mind that the general roadmap is to make
the existing features stable and get them tested.

* When making additions to the project, consider if the majority of users will benefit from your change. If not, you're
  probably better off forking the project.
* Also consider if your change will get in the way of other users. A good change is a change that enhances the
  experience of some users who want that change and does not affect users who do not care about the change.

## Pull Requests Guidelines

- Commits are squashed into fewer, logically organized commits
- Format the code to be like the eclipse auto format tool on factory settings, but also run-on lines of code long enough
  to go off the screen and single line if statements and other format violations in that category are welcome if it
  helps enhance the contrast between the less important code and the more important code in a file. Don't commit changes
  to `compiled/web/classes.js` or `compiled/web/classes_server.js` or `compiled/web/packs` or anything in `compiled/` (
  besides the html file). I'll recompile those myself when I merge the pull request.
